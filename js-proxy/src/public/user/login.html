        This site is created for academic purposes. The main idea is to collect mouse data of the user who is using this site. When you decide to use this website you agree with collecting your mouse data such as coordinates of the pointer, clicks of buttons, and use of the scroll button. The data will be used for preparing a bachelor's degree thesis - <i>"Protection of a web application with behavioral biometrics"</i>. The data will not be published in a thesis or in another way. Also, it will be deleted after completion of the study. The login credentials are collated with mouse data to distinguish behavior purposes. All data are anonymous. We kindly ask you to create an account with login and password which are not used in other applications or websites due to additional security and anonymousness. You can use this site many times, so we kindly ask to use the same account to associate data with the same user.
